## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite (upgradeable to PostgreSQL)
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude API
- **Styling**: CSS/Styled Components (TBD)
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Deployment**: Debian Linux server with Docker

### Key Features to Implement:
1. **Data Management**: CRUD operations for airlines, features, implementations
2. **Implementation Matrix**: Grid interface for feature-airline relationships
3. **Natural Language Queries**: AI-powered question answering
4. **Context Retrieval**: Smart data fetching based on user queries
5. **Chat Interface**: Conversational UI with history

### Example Queries to Support:
- "Which airlines support dynamic pricing?"
- "Is 'Unaccompanied Minor' supported for airline AA?"
- "Compare features across Altea NDC airlines"
- "List all production airlines with Accelya"

## Next Steps

Please review these milestones and let me know:
1. If the scope and timeline look reasonable
2. Any specific requirements or constraints I should consider
3. Which milestone you'd like me to start with
4. Any questions about the technical approach

Once approved, I'll begin implementation starting with Milestone 1.

## Docker & Production Deployment Considerations

### Docker Configuration:
- **Frontend Container**: React app served via Nginx
- **Backend Container**: Node.js/Express.js application  
- **Database**: SQLite file with volume mounting for persistence
- **Multi-stage builds**: Optimize container sizes
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management

### Deployment Requirements:
- **Target Server**: Debian Linux with Docker installed
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose for service management
- **Data Persistence**: Volume mounts for database and uploads
- **Port Configuration**: Proper port mapping for web access
- **Security**: Environment-based secrets management

### Repository Structure:
```
/
├── frontend/          # React TypeScript app
├── backend/           # Node.js Express API
├── docker/            # Docker configuration files
├── docs/              # Documentation
├── .github/           # GitHub workflows (optional)
├── docker-compose.yml # Multi-container setup
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Git Workflow Strategy

### Branch Structure:
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: Individual feature development
- **hotfix/***: Critical fixes for production

### Commit Conventions:
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Example: `feat(api): add airline CRUD endpoints`
